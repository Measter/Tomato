# Tomato

Tomato is the collective name for a series of tools built around DCPU-16 emulation. Tomato
itself is a .NET library for emulating DCPU-16 and all official 0x10c hardware. Also included
is Lettuce, a graphical debugger for DCPU-16 programs. Also included is Pickles, a text-based
debugger for the command line. All three run on Windows, Linux, and Mac.

## Installation

On Linux and Mac, you must first install Mono to use any Tomato-based software.

### Tomato

Tomato is easy. Simply head to the [Downloads](https://github.com/Measter/Tomato/releases)
page and grab Tomato.dll, which you can immediately begin using in your projects.

### Lettuce

Lettuce is also easy, but requires OpenGL to emulate SPED-3 devices. Grab Lettuce from the
[Downloads](https://github.com/Measter/Tomato/releases) page and head over to
http://www.opengl.org/ for information on installing OpenGL (hint: you probably already have
it installed).

### Pickles

Pickles is as easy as Tomato. Grab it from the
[Downloads](https://github.com/Measter/Tomato/releases) page to get started.

## Usage

If you just want a quick emulator, grab [Lettuce](https://github.com/Measter/Tomato/releases)
and run it. On Windows, double click the file. On Linux or Mac, run this:

    mono Lettuce.exe

A nice little wizard will guide you through the rest.

For advanced users, head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/Tomato/wiki) for
extensive documentation on all Tomato-related software.
